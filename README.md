# 📌 DFB-Pokal: Does It Have Its Own Rules?

This repository contains my seminar project for the course **Visualization of Sports Data** at TU Dortmund University.

The aim of the project is to explore whether DFB-Pokal upsets can be explained by measurable structural and financial factors, rather than randomness.  
The analysis focuses on division gaps, tournament rounds, squad market value differences, and trends across seasons.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The study examines three main question areas:

### **1. Money Factor**
- Does the squad market value difference predict match outcomes?
- Do smaller financial gaps increase the chance of an upset?

### **2. Structural Factors**
- How does the division gap affect upset probability?
- Are underdogs more successful in certain rounds?

### **3. Seasonal Trends**
- Have upset rates changed across seasons?
- Are some years consistently more surprising than others?

## 🛠 Methods & Tools

- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Win-rate analysis
- Hypothesis testing (Chi-square, Mann–Whitney, Welch t-test)
- Data visualization
- Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory analysis

## 📈 Key Findings (Short Summary)

- Larger squad value gaps strongly reduce the chance of an upset.  
- Upsets are most common when the division gap is small.  
- Middle rounds show higher upset rates than early or late rounds.  
- No strong long-term trend in upset frequency across seasons.  
- The “magic of the cup” still exists — patterns help explain probabilities, but surprises persist.
